#pip is a utility
#pip is the standard package-management system used to install
# and manage software packages written in the Python environment.
# Many packages are found in the default source for packages
# and their dependencies â€” Python Package Index (PyPI) (www.pypi.org)

#Most distributions of Python come with pip preinstalled.
#pip is a recursive acronym for "Pip Installs Packages"
#python -m pip --version or python -m pip -V
#python -m pip install requests
#NOTE: Depending on how you have your environment variables configured, you can
#skip the python -m (which looks/searches in the python path for the pip utility).
#However, make sure that you are installing the package to the correct interpreter
#if you have multiple versions of python installed
#pip install requests
#NOTE: You may not have full permissions on the python directory
#python -m pip install --user requests

print(r.status_code == requests.codes.ok)

#if you want to unistall the requests package
#python -m pip uninstall requests



#Let's review loading data from a text file into a series of data structures in python
