#Dealing with dates can be frustrating because
#Dates come in all different formats, which can make it difficult to add
# or subtract dates or to compare values against specific dates.

#In a banking context,
#selecting all the accounts that have past due loan payments involve manipulating dates
#
#In a HR context, find all employees hired before or after a specific date
#to help calculate benefit eligibility involve manipulating dates.
#
#In a marketing context, find all customers who made multiple purchases in a given month
# involve manipulating dates
#
#In an accounting context, identify all journal entries that were entered in the last week of a quarter
#and the first week of a quarter.

#Once we have a date in a datetime object, we can manipulate the dates quite easily but
#converting them to a datetime object can be challenging due to the different date formats.

#Let's first work with the datetime module/library
import datetime

#today fetches the current date
print(datetime.date.today())

#Create a date object with a specific year, month, day
dt = datetime.date(2020, 10, 20)
print(type(dt))
print(dt)

#now we can extract the components of the date object
print(dt.day)
print(dt.month)
print(dt.year)

#We can also convert dates to strings using the strftime function
#This function takes the format as an argument (see below for formatting flags).
dt = datetime.date.today()
print(dt)
sdt = dt.strftime('%m-%d-%Y')
print(type(sdt))
print('The current date is ' + sdt)

sdt = dt.strftime('%a, %d-%m-%y')
print(sdt)
sdt = dt.strftime('%A, %B %d, %Y')
print(sdt)

#Common datetime formatting options are as follows:
#%d refers to day of the month. In 20-10-2019, %d returns 20.
#%m refers to month of the year. In 20-10-2019, %m returns 10.
#%Y refers to year. The letter 'Y' is in upper case. In 20-10-2019, %Y returns 2019.
#%y refers to year in two-digit format. In 20-10-2019, %y returns 19.
#%a returns the first three letter of the weekday Sun
#%A returns the complete name of the weekday Sunday
#%b returns the first three letters of the month Oct
#%B returns the complete name of the month October
#Some time flags are as follows:
#%I converts 24 hour time format to 12 hour format.
#%p returns AM PM based on time values.
#%H returns hours of the time value.
#%M returns minutes of the time value.
#%S returns seconds of the time value.

#We can also work with time objects using the datetime class
t = datetime.time(21, 2, 3)
print(t)
print(type(t))
print(t.hour)
print(t.minute)
print(t.second)
#Add in microseconds to our datetime.time object
t = datetime.time(21, 2, 3, 4352)
print(t.microsecond)

#Now that we have a time object, we can format our time however we want/need
#using the strftime function
print(t.strftime('%I:%M %p'))
print(t.strftime('%I:%M:%S %p'))
print(t.strftime('%I:%M:%S.%f %p'))

#Now let's work with both dates and times together by extracting the current date & time using the
#now() function and just a datetime function
dt = datetime.datetime(2020, 3, 20, 11, 33, 14)
print(type(dt))
print(dt)
dt = datetime.datetime.now()
print(type(dt))
print(dt)
#Depending on where you live in the world, the format of the above datetime might be in a different
#format.

#The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) date
# format is a standard way to express a numeric calendar date that eliminates ambiguity.
#Note that the isoformat() function results in a string and not a datetime object.
dt = datetime.datetime.now()
my_date = dt.isoformat()  #is this a date or a string object?
print(type(my_date))
print(my_date)

#my_date = 'Jun 28 2018  7:40AM'

#The first useful function here is the strptime function
parsed_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(my_date, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S')
parsed_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(my_date, '%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f')
parsed_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(my_date, '%b %d %Y %I:%M%p')
print(type(parsed_date))
print(parsed_date)

#Now we can print out the date in whatever format we want using the strftime function
print(parsed_date.strftime('%A %B %d %X'))
print(parsed_date.strftime('%A %B %d %H:%M'))
print(parsed_date.strftime('%A %B %d %H:%M:%S'))

#Now we can extract the dates and times from our datetime objects
print('Date:', parsed_date.date(), 'Time:', parsed_date.time())

#python -m pip install dateutils
