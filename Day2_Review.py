#     and the value being the name of the mountain they would like to climb.
#     Then, ask the user if they would like another person to take our
#     mountain climbing poll.  If they enter yes, repeat the poll.  If they enter no, end the poll and
#     return the dictionary object to the calling statement/expression.
#     Call the function and print the dictionary object that gets returned from the function.
