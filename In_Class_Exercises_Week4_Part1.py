#In Python, a function is a group of related statements that perform a specific task.

#Functions help break our program into smaller and modular chunks.
# As our scripts grow larger and larger, functions make them more
# organized, readable, and manageable.

#Functions also avoid repetition, which makes code more reusable and less error proned.

#Basically, we can divide functions into the following two types:
#Built-in functions - Functions that are built into Python.
#User-defined functions - Functions defined by the users themselves.

#def marks the start of function header.
#A function name to uniquely identify it. Function naming follows the same rules of writing identifiers in Python.
#Parameters are contained in the ()s and are used to pass values to a function. They are optional.
#A colon(:) is used to mark the end of the function header.
#Optional (but best practice) documentation uses a docstring to describe what the function does.
#Then, we have the body of the function, which contains one or more valid python statements that
#make up the function body. Statements must have the same indentation level(usually 4 spaces).
# An optional return statement will return a value from the function.

#The def statement creates the function, but it is not executed until it is actually called.
#Notice what happens when we fail to pass in a argument.

	"""This function prints a message
	    based on the name parameter"""

#Scope of a variable is the portion of a program where the variable is recognized.
# Parameters and variables defined inside a function are not visible from outside.
# Hence, they have a local scope.

#Lifetime of a variable is the period throughout which the variable exists in the memory.
# The lifetime of variables inside a function only as long as the function executes.

#They are destroyed once we return from the function.
# Hence, a function does not remember the value of a variable
# from its previous calls.

#Recursion is the process of defining something in terms of itself.
#A physical world example would be to place two parallel mirrors
# facing each other. Any object in between them would be reflected recursively.

# An example of a recursive function to
# find the factorial of a number

#Following is an example of recursive function to find the factorial of an integer.
#Factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number.
# For example, the factorial of 6 (denoted as 6!) is 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720.

#Our recursion ends when the number reduces to 1. This is called the base condition.
#Every recursive function must have a base condition that stops the recursion
# or else the function calls itself infinitely.

#How is this working
#calc_factorial(4)              # 1st call with 4

#Advantages of Recursion
#Recursive functions make the code look clean and elegant.
#A complex task can be broken down into simpler sub-problems using recursion.
#Sequence generation is easier with recursion than using some nested iteration.

#Disadvantages of Recursion
#Sometimes the logic behind recursion is hard to follow through.
#Recursive calls are expensive (inefficient) as they take up a lot of memory and time.
# Recursive functions are hard to debug.

#In Python, anonymous function is a function that is defined without a name.
#While normal functions are defined using the def keyword, in Python anonymous
# functions are defined using the lambda keyword.
# Hence, anonymous functions are also called lambda functions.

# Program to show the use of lambda functions
#In the above program, lambda x: x * 2 is the lambda function.
# Here x is the parameter and x * 2 is the expression that gets evaluated and returned.
#This function has no name. It returns a function object which is assigned to the
# identifier double. We can now call it as a normal function.
triple = lambda x: x * 3
print(triple(6))
print(type(triple))
#The following function privides the same functionality
def triple(x):
   return x * 3

#We use lambda functions when we require a nameless function for a short period of time.
#In Python, we generally use it as an argument to a higher-order function
# (a function that takes in other functions as arguments).
# Lambda functions are used along with built-in functions like filter(), map(), etc.

#The filter() function in Python takes in a function and a list as arguments.
#The function is called with all the items in the list and a new list is
# returned which contains items for which the function evaluates to True.
#Here is an example use of filter() function to filter out only even numbers from a list.

# Program to filter out only the even items from a list

#The map() function in Python takes in a function and a list.
#The function is called with all the items in the list and
# a new list is returned which contains items returned
# by that function for each item.

#Here is an example use of map() function to double all the items in a list.

#Nonlocal variables are used in nested function

#Activity...Let's build a program for a color guessing (mastermind) game.
#The computer will automatically generate four colors from a list of possible colors.
#It should be possible for the computer to randomly select the same color more than once in the list of four colors.
#For instance, the computer may choose 'red','blue','red','green' in that order.
# The specific sequence of the computer's selections should not be displayed to the user
# because the user will attempt to guess the colors in the correct order.

#After the computer makes its four color selections, the user should enter
# their choice of four colors from the same list that the computer used.
# For instance, the user may choose pink, blue, yellow, and red.  The user should
#be given four inputs to select their four colors.  The sequence of the user's selections matters because
#the user is attempting to match the colors in the correct order.

#After the user has made their four color selections, your program should show how many colors they got
# right in the correct position and how many colors they got right but in the wrong position.

#For instance,
#Computer randomly picks: 'red', 'blue', 'red', 'blue'
#User enters: 'pink', 'blue', 'yellow', 'red'

#In the above example, the program should display messages similar to the following:
# 'Correct color in the correct place: 1' and
#'Correct color but the wrong place: 1'

#The game should continue until the user correctly enters the four colors in the proper order.
#At the end of the game, your program should display a suitable
#message and tell them how many guesses they took to get the correct answer.

#This task will require your to split up the tasks into separate functions,
#use lists, use the random module, use if statements, loops, and other skills!

#The colors for this game are the following:
#red, blue, orange, yellow, pink, green, and white

#Have the user just enter the first letter of the colors instead of the full color names.

#Once the computer randomly picks its four choices, those are the four colors for the
#duration of the game.
